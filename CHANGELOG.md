# Changelog

All notable changes to Listings Analyzer are documented here.

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`/manage/scrape-redfin` endpoint** — scrapes all Redfin listing URLs via Jina reader to backfill missing fields: `property_type`, `lot_acres`, `property_tax_json` (annual amount), `garage_count`, `garage_type`, `hoa_monthly`, `list_date`, and `price` (force-corrected when current value < $100k, indicating a data error). Runs synchronously; returns per-listing results.
- **`property_type` and `lot_acres` in `manage/update-listing`** — these fields now accepted by the manage update endpoint (previously only numeric/address fields were allowed).
- **`force` param in `manage/update-listing`** — pass `"force": true` in the JSON body to overwrite existing field values (default behavior still only fills null/empty fields).
- **`force` param in `db.update_listing_fields_by_id()`** — internal DB helper now accepts `force=True` to unconditionally overwrite columns.

### Added (previous)
- **Split Display Settings / AI Criteria panels** — ⚙ gear now opens Display Settings only (auto-saves on toggle, no Save button). ✨ AI Criteria button opens a separate overlay for the criteria editor, version history, rescore progress, and maintenance. Prevents accidental criteria saves when changing display prefs.
- **Gear button uniform height** — settings button now matches height of AI Criteria and Check Email buttons (38px fixed height, 22px icon).
- **AI failure retry + `ai_failed` flag** — `ai_score_listing()` now retries once on `JSONDecodeError` before giving up. On persistent failure uses `evaluation_method='ai_failed'` instead of `'deterministic'`; `_should_skip()` always forces rescore for `ai_failed` listings. Dashboard shows a ⚠ Score pending badge on affected cards; data confidence tooltip includes count of pending listings.
- **`ai_failed` card visual treatment** — cards with `evaluation_method='ai_failed'` show `?` in faint gray (not `0`) for score, amber left border + reduced opacity, and a yellow "↻ Retry scoring" button in the expanded action row. Clicking it calls `POST /listings/{id}/rescore`, shows a toast, and refreshes the list.
- **Improved junk image filter** — `system_files`, `150x150`, `120x120`, `mapHomeCard`, `genMap`, `genBcs` URL patterns added to the filter list; prevents Redfin map tiles, nearby-sale thumbnails, and micro-thumbnails from being sent to the AI (was causing JSON parse failures on some listings).
- **Scorer retry robustness** — `APIError` and unexpected exceptions on the *retry* attempt are now also caught and produce `ai_failed` instead of crashing the caller.
- **Tests: `ai_score_listing()` error paths** — `TestAiScoreListingErrorPaths` (5 tests): no API key → deterministic, JSON error retries twice, API error → ai_failed, JSON error then API error on retry → ai_failed (not crash), unexpected exception → ai_failed.
- **Tests: junk image filter** — `TestJunkImageFilter` (3 tests): `system_files` URLs excluded, `genBcs` URLs excluded, badge/flag URLs excluded.
- **Tests: `_should_skip` ai_failed + scored_at=None** — 2 new cases in `TestSkipUnchanged`: `ai_failed` always rescores, `scored_at=None` always rescores.
- **Sqft hard requirement lowered to 2,200 sqft** — criteria v55. Hard reject threshold changed from 2,400 → 2,200 sqft. 2,200–2,400 sqft range carries a severe soft penalty (-12 to -15) to avoid missed borderline listings while still strongly discouraging small homes.
- **CI test gate** — GitHub Actions workflow updated to run `pytest tests/ -x -q` before deploying. Deploy job requires test job to pass. Uses `uv sync --dev` + mock env vars for API keys.
- **Hide pending/sold toggle** — third display preference in settings: "Hide pending/sold listings" (default OFF) excludes listings where `listing_status` is Pending, Sold, Under Contract, or Closed from All view. Filter counts respect this preference.
- **"Active" filter chip** — renamed from "Non-Reject" to "Active" (clearer label; same behavior: excludes Reject verdict listings).
- **Settings modal with display preferences** — gear icon (⚙) in top nav (auth-only) opens a redesigned settings modal with a "Display Preferences" section above the AI Criteria editor. Preferences are persisted to `localStorage` and apply immediately: "Hide passed listings" toggle (default ON), "Default filter on load" dropdown (All / Non-Reject), "Default sort" dropdown (all existing sort options). Filter counts respect the hide-passed preference.
- **Hide passed listings from default views** — passed listings are now excluded from All, Non-Reject, Toured, and Want to Go views by default. They remain visible via the dedicated "Passed" filter chip. Controlled by the "Hide passed" display preference (default ON).
- **Tests for `parse_list_date()`** — `TestParseListDate` (11 tests): None input, empty string, no-date description, ISO date after "listed on", ISO date after "date listed", US date after "listed", US date after "on market since", long-form month, abbreviated month, update-date non-match, return format validation.
- **Tests for `fetch_property_tax_orpts()` county fallback** — `TestFetchPropertyTaxOrpts` (8 tests): import, missing address, missing town, municipality map presence, successful pass-1 lookup, county fallback on empty pass-1, both-passes-empty returns None, network error, cache hit, address-without-number returns None.
- **Confidence tooltip with per-field breakdown** — mouseover on the `XX% data` nav pill now shows a floating panel with each field's coverage % and a color-coded mini bar chart (green ≥90%, amber ≥70%, red <70%). Built as a custom div tooltip rather than a plain `title` attribute.
- **`parse_list_date()` description parser** — extracts on-market list date from stored description text. Handles ISO (`2026-01-15`), US (`01/15/2026`), and long-form (`January 15, 2026`) date formats after "listed on", "date listed", "on market since" cues. Wired into `_enrich_all()` to backfill `list_date` for listings missing DOM data. `list_date` added to `allowed_cols` whitelist in `db.py`.
- **ORPTS county-level fallback** — `fetch_property_tax_orpts()` now does a two-pass lookup: (1) municipality-scoped (existing), then (2) county-level (`county_name='Westchester'`) if the first pass returns no results. Fixes mismatches where village/hamlet parcels are filed under a different ORPTS municipality than the mailing address (e.g. Scarsdale addresses → Greenburgh; Bedford Rd addresses → North Castle). Expected to recover ~6-8 additional listings.
- **Data confidence indicator in top nav** — weighted composite score (0–100%) shown as a pill in the dark header bar. Covers 9 fields weighted by scoring impact: description 20%, images 15%, schools 15%, commute 15%, year built 10%, lot size 8%, basement 7%, property tax 5%, garage 5%. Color-coded green/amber/red (≥80%/60–79%/<60%). Tooltip shows field list on hover.
- **Property Details section in expanded card** — new `buildPropertyDetails()` JS function renders enriched data not previously shown in the UI: lot size (acres or sqft), garage count/type, HOA fee (or "None"), pool, basement type, assessed value (ORPTS/SODA), FEMA flood zone (with ⚠️ if SFHA), power line proximity, and nearest Metro-North station + walk time. Displayed as a compact 2-column grid below the commute/schools section.

### Removed
- **Listing description from expanded card** — marketing text removed from detail view; full listing is accessible via the "View full listing →" link.

### Added (previous)
- **`parse_year_built()` description parser** — extracts year built from Redfin-style descriptions. Handles `"YYYY year built"` (Redfin metadata format) and `"built in YYYY"` patterns. Filters out listing-update dates (2026+). Wired into `_enrich_all()` for automatic backfill on listings missing `year_built`. Expected to fill ~10 of 12 previously missing values (79% → ~97% coverage). `year_built` added to `allowed_cols` whitelist in `db.py`.
- **ORPTS municipality map expanded** — added 14 new hamlet→municipality mappings: Irvington, Dobbs Ferry, Hartsdale, Ardsley, Elmsford (Greenburgh); Thornwood (Mount Pleasant); Rye Brook, Port Chester (Rye); Cortlandt Manor (Cortlandt); Beacon (Dutchess); Highland/Lloyd (Ulster); Palisades/Orangetown (Rockland). Expected to improve property tax coverage from 37% → ~55-60% for NY listings.
- **Direct geocoder call for lat/lng** — `_enrich_all()` now calls `_geocode_address()` directly instead of relying on stale in-memory cache. Fixes 0% lat/lng coverage on previously-geocoded listings.
- **HOA re-parse on every enrichment cycle** — removes `is None` guard so stale/wrong HOA values (e.g., property-tax amounts misclassified as HOA fees) get corrected on next enrichment run.
- **9 new tests for `parse_year_built`** — `TestParseYearBuilt` in `test_enrichment.py`: Redfin metadata format, `year built: YYYY`, `built in YYYY`, `constructed in YYYY`, listing-date filter, none input, no-year description, renovation-year disambiguation. 144 total enrichment tests passing.

### Fixed
- **HOA false positive from property tax amounts** — removed greedy `$X,XXX hoa/dues` regex pattern that matched dollar amounts preceding "hoa dues $0" (e.g., "property taxes $1,992 hoa dues $0" → wrongly stored $1,992 as HOA). Four listings affected. Fixed no-HOA regex to also match `hoa dues $0` pattern. Two regression tests added.
- **lat/lng 0% coverage** — previous fix relied on in-memory geocode cache which is empty on each container start. Now calls geocoder directly; cache hit is instant if the address was already geocoded in the same enrichment run.

### Added
- **Description parsing: garage, HOA, pool, basement** — Four new regex-based parsers in `enrichment.py`: `parse_garage_count()` (count + attached/detached/carport), `parse_hoa_amount()` (monthly/annual fees), `parse_pool_flag()` (inground/above-ground/community), `parse_basement()` (finished/partially finished/unfinished/walk-out). All pure code, no API calls. 7 new DB columns: `garage_count`, `garage_type`, `hoa_monthly`, `has_pool`, `pool_type`, `has_basement`, `basement_type`. Wired into `_enrich_all()` for automatic backfill and `_build_listing_data()` for AI scoring.
- **Criteria v52** — structured data references for garage, pool, basement, HOA. Expanded amenities section with per-signal scoring. Basement: +5 walk-out/finished, +2 partially finished, 0 unfinished, -3 slab/no basement. Pool: -5 inground, -3 above-ground, 0 no pool/community.
- **31 new tests** — `TestParseGarageCount` (8), `TestParseHoaAmount` (7), `TestParsePoolFlag` (7), `TestParseBasement` (9). 133 total enrichment tests passing.
- **Metro-North station proximity** — `fetch_station_proximity()` in `enrichment.py` finds nearest Metro-North station using a static 61-station dataset (Harlem, Hudson, New Haven lines). No API call at runtime. Returns station name, distance_m, walk_minutes (at 5km/h). `station_json TEXT` column added. Passed to AI scorer as `nearest_metro_north`.
- **Criteria v50** — flood zone penalty adjusted: Zone AE/VE -20 (was -15), Zone X 500-year 0 (was -5).
- **Criteria v51** — Metro-North station walking distance scoring: +5 under 10 min walk, 0 at 10–20 min, -5 over 20 min.
- **6 new tests for station proximity** — `TestFetchStationProximity` in `test_enrichment.py`.
- **FEMA flood zone detection** — `fetch_flood_zone()` in `enrichment.py` queries FEMA NFHL ArcGIS REST API (free, no key) by lat/lon. Returns `fld_zone`, `zone_subty`, and `sfha` (bool). `flood_zone_json TEXT` column added to `listings` table. Passed to AI scorer as `flood_zone` structured field.
- **Criteria v47** — calibration rebalance from buyer preference study: base 25→30, school average 0 (was +5), GFBath +8 (was +15), 4BR +8 (was +10), basement +5 (was +10), commute >110 -15 (was -10).
- **Power line proximity detection** — `fetch_power_line_proximity()` queries OSM Overpass API (free) for high-voltage transmission infrastructure (power=line/cable/tower) within 300m radius. Returns nearest distance, type, voltage. `lat REAL`, `lng REAL`, `power_line_json TEXT` columns added.
- **Criteria v48** — power line scoring: -5 at 150–299m, -10 at 75–149m, -15 under 75m.
- **Criteria v49** — flood zone scoring: -15 Zone AE/VE (SFHA), -10 Zone A, -5 Zone X 500-year, 0 Zone X minimal.
- **10 new tests for power line proximity** — `TestHaversineM`, `TestGeocodeAddress`, `TestFetchPowerLineProximity` in `test_enrichment.py`.
- **7 new tests for flood zone** — `TestFetchFloodZone` in `test_enrichment.py`: zone X, zone AE (SFHA), empty features, cache, network error, SFHA zone coverage.
- **NY ORPTS property tax** — `fetch_property_tax_orpts()` in `enrichment.py` queries NY State ORPTS API (`data.ny.gov/resource/7vem-aaz7.json`) for assessed/taxable values for Westchester and other NY municipalities outside NYC. Integrated as fallback after NYC SODA. Municipality names mapped via `_ORPTS_MUNICIPALITY_MAP` (40+ hamlet→town mappings). Streets queried as UPPERCASE with suffix in same field.
- **Lot size as structured field** — `lot_acres REAL` column added to `listings` table; extracted from listing pages via JSON-LD `lotSize` (object and string forms), text "X.XX acres", and "N,NNN sq ft lot"; valid range 0.01–1000 acres; backfilled from stored description text in Phase 4 of `/manage/scrape-descriptions`.
- **`clear_bogus_commute` flag** — `POST /manage/enrich?clear_bogus_commute=true` nulls commute data for listings where `commute_mode == "transit"` (pure transit = walk/bus, unreliable for suburban areas). Forces re-enrichment with drive+transit mode.
- **Criteria v43** — garage scoring (+5 two-car, +2 one-car, 0 no garage); pool penalty reduced -15→-5; HOA folded into carrying cost (no direct penalty, flag if >$500/mo); lot/drainage scoring (+3 to +5 elevated/hillside, -3 low-lying).
- **Criteria v44** — lot_acres context added to instructions for AI scoring.
- **Criteria v45–v46** — sqft penalty restructured: 4,000–4,500 sqft → -5 pts, 4,500+ → -12 pts (starts at 4,000 per buyer preference, not 3,800).
- **7 new tests for ORPTS** — `TestFetchPropertyTaxOrpts` in `test_enrichment.py`: municipality map contents, structured data return, not-found case, exception handling, missing inputs, cache hit, NYC SODA fallthrough.
- **7 new tests for lot size extraction** — `TestLotAcresExtraction` in `test_onehome_parser.py`: JSON-LD object, JSON-LD string (acres + sqft), visible text (acres + sqft), unrealistic value rejection, priority order.

### Changed
- **Phase 4 backfill in `/manage/scrape-descriptions`** — now also backfills `lot_acres` from stored description text for listings missing the field (in addition to year_built/list_date).
- **`_NUMERIC_COLUMNS`** added in `db.py` — ensures `lot_acres` (REAL) uses `IS NULL` checks instead of `= ''` in `update_listing_fields_by_id`.

### Fixed
- **API tests broken by lot_acres Phase 4** — mock listings in `test_api.py` updated to include `lot_acres: 0.5`, preventing Phase 4 from hitting unmocked DB calls.
- **`test_reprocess_finds_urls`** — added mock for `db.backfill_listing_address` (was calling unmocked DB function).

### Added (previous session)
- **GFB 4-signal inference** — scorer system prompt expanded with explicit 4-signal framework for ground-floor bedroom determination: (1) floor plan image labels (Den/Study/Guest Room on ground floor), (2) description text patterns ("first floor bedroom", "in-law suite", "master on main"), (3) photo examination (beds visible at ground level), (4) property type + age inference (ranch = always GFB, Colonial/Tudor = rarely). Opus commits at 60%+ confidence; only returns "unknown" if all four signals are absent/contradictory.
- **Criteria v42** — tiered school scoring (+25 strong/95th+ percentile, +15 good/80–94th, +5 average/below 80th; previously flat +35); steeper price taper (-5 at $1.5–1.65M, -10 at $1.65–1.8M, -15 above $1.8M; previously -5 to -10 flat); price/sqft signal doubled (±10, was ±5); old "Condition" section collapsed into "Age & Physical Condition" — eliminates double-counting.
- **`/manage/update-listing` endpoint** — update individual listing fields (year_built, price, sqft, bedrooms, bathrooms, address, town, state, zip_code) by listing ID without re-scraping. Protected by MANAGE_KEY.
- **year_built backfill** — scraped Redfin via Jina Reader for 3 listings missing the field: #62 (31 Lalli Dr, Katonah) → 1994, #483 (175 Palmer Ln, Thornwood) → 1948.

### Added
- **Age/condition scoring** — `score_age_condition()` in `enrichment.py` computes age tier adjustment (pre-1940 → -22 pts up to 2005+ → 0) and keyword scan of listing description (e.g. "new roof" +6, "sold as is" -12, "fixer-upper" -12). Result passed to AI scorer as `age_condition` signal. No external API required.
- **Price/sqft market benchmark** — `get_price_per_sqft_signal()` loads Zillow ZHVI CSV at startup (~5MB), computes listing $/sqft vs ZIP-level median benchmark, returns `below_market`/`at_market`/`above_market` signal. Passed to AI as `price_per_sqft_signal`.
- **Property tax enrichment** — `fetch_property_tax()` queries NY Open Data SODA API (free, no key) for NYC assessed/market values. Stored as `property_tax_json` column. Passed to AI as `property_tax`.
- **Scoring criteria v41** — updated instructions to use all 3 new structured signals.
- **DB migration** — `property_tax_json TEXT` column added to listings table.
- **Image audit endpoint** — `GET /manage/image-audit` reports image coverage stats: total listings, listings with/without images, listings with unknowns in scoring, sample of high-priority targets needing images; protected by MANAGE_KEY
- **Force rescrape unknowns** — `POST /manage/rescrape-unknowns` targets listings with "Unknown" hard requirements and insufficient images (<3); re-scrapes listing URLs for images, updates DB, re-scores with images; protected by MANAGE_KEY

### Changed
- **Enhanced AI prompt for unknowns** — scorer system prompt now explicitly instructs AI to penalize unknowns heavily: each unknown hard requirement reduces score by 10-15 points, unknown basement by 15-20 points; 3+ unknowns should result in Weak Match or Low Priority (30-50 range), not 60+; floor plans are critical for determining basement finish, ground-floor bedrooms, detached status

### Added
- **"Passed" status** — `passed` boolean column on listings; `POST /listings/{id}/passed` toggle endpoint (auth-required); orange "Passed" badge in compact card row; "Pass" / "Passed — click to undo" button in detail actions; "Passed" filter chip with count; `/passed` URL route
- **Redfin CDN image enumeration** — `enumerate_redfin_images()` in `onehome.py` probes sequential Redfin CDN photo indices (HEAD requests, 0–80) to discover all listing photos; static HTML scraping captures ~7 but listings often have 30–50+; called automatically from `_extract_image_urls()` when Redfin CDN URLs detected
- **Smart image selection for scoring** — `_select_scoring_images()` in `scorer.py` picks a representative blend of 8 images: 3 from start (hero/kitchen), 2 from middle, 3 from end (floor plans/basement); ensures floor plans (typically last images) are always seen by the AI scorer
- **Phase 2.5 in `/manage/scrape-descriptions`** — re-enumerates Redfin CDN images for existing listings with fewer than 10 images; fills in the full photo set without re-scraping

### Changed
- **Removed verdict tags from compact cards** — "Strong Match", "Worth Touring", etc. pills removed from compact card row (score number + color already conveys the tier); removed `Strong Match`, `Worth Touring`, `Reject` filter chips and their `/strong-match`, `/worth-touring`, `/reject` URL routes; kept `Non-Reject` filter and verdict CSS for detail view
- **`_MAX_IMAGES` bumped from 5 → 8** — peak memory ~52MB per 5-listing chunk, safe on 1024MB Fly.io
- **Scorer image hint updated** — now mentions floor plans, office/den, and room layout in the image examination prompt

### Added
- **"Want to Go" flag** — `tour_requested` boolean column on listings; `POST /listings/{id}/tour-request` toggle endpoint (auth-required); blue "Want to Go" badge in compact card row; "Want to Go" / "✓ Want to Go — click to cancel" button in detail actions; "Want to Go" filter chip with count; mirrors the existing Toured pattern
- **Add listing from URL** — `POST /listings/add` endpoint creates a new listing from a pasted URL; resolves short URLs (redf.in), extracts address from Redfin URL path, scrapes description/images, extracts structured data (price/beds/baths/sqft), enriches (schools/commute), scores with AI; dashboard shows URL input bar when signed in; duplicate detection by address key
- **Filter chip routes** — each filter has its own URL: `/non-reject`, `/strong-match`, `/worth-touring`, `/reject`, `/toured`, `/want-to-go`; shareable links that pre-filter the dashboard; browser back/forward supported via `pushState`
- **Public repo hardening** — removed hardcoded personal emails from config defaults and `.env.example`; all personal config now env-var-only

### Changed
- **Auto-update listing status on duplicate detection** — when poller encounters a duplicate listing (by MLS ID or address key), it now updates the existing listing's `listing_status` if changed (e.g., "New Listing" → "Pending") and backfills `listing_url` if the existing record has none; previously duplicates were silently skipped
- **Improved sold/pending detection via OneKey MLS** — `_prune_sold_listings()` now has two passes: (1) Redfin URLs via Jina Reader (existing), (2) OneKey MLS status check via DDG search for all remaining listings; OneKey MLS pages include structured `SaleStatus`/`MlsStatus` JSON fields accessible from cloud IPs (unlike Redfin which blocks Jina from Fly.io)
- **Pending listings preserved** — listings detected as "Pending" or "Under Contract" now get `listing_status` updated to "Pending" instead of being deleted; sold indicators and pending indicators are now separate lists

### Added
- **`check_listing_status()` in `onehome.py`** — searches DDG for OneKey MLS page and extracts `SaleStatus`/`MlsStatus` from page JSON; returns status string ("Active", "Sold", "Pending", "Closed") or None; reuses existing DDG rate limiting
- **`_extract_listing_status()` in `onehome.py`** — regex extraction of listing status from OneKey MLS HTML embedded JSON
- **OneKey MLS address search fallback** — when Redfin scraping fails and no MLS ID is available (bare Redfin URLs), DDG searches for the address on OneKey MLS; wired into the Redfin scraping chain after existing fallbacks
- **Structured data extraction from scraped pages** — `_extract_property_stats()` regex-extracts price/beds/baths/sqft from any listing page HTML; `scrape_listing_structured_data()` combines DDG search + fetch + extraction
- **Structured data backfill in poller** — before scoring, bare-URL listings missing price/beds/baths/sqft get data backfilled from OneKey MLS; prevents "missing data" rejections
- **Phase 3 in `/manage/scrape-descriptions`** — after URL search and description scraping, backfills structured property data for listings missing all of price/beds/baths/sqft; triggers rescore if data found
- **HTML URL backfill in PlainTextParser** — `parse()` now extracts Redfin listing URLs from the HTML portion of emails and matches them to text-parsed listings by address; fills in `listing_url` for listings that had no URL in the plain text body
- **DB connection timeouts** — `psycopg2.connect()` now uses `connect_timeout=5` and `statement_timeout=30000` (30s); `sqlite3.connect()` uses `timeout=5`; prevents indefinite hangs when Postgres is unreachable
- **Chunked batch rescore** — `_rescore_all()` now processes listings in chunks of 5 (`_BATCH_CHUNK_SIZE`) instead of building all batch requests in memory at once; peak memory drops from ~193MB to ~33MB; Batch API 50% discount preserved
- **`POST /manage/data-quality` endpoint** — audits listings with missing address, URL, or town (dry-run by default); with `?fix=true`: deletes no-address listings, backfills missing towns from Redfin URLs, resets orphaned emails, triggers re-poll + rescore; protected by MANAGE_KEY
- **Listing validation gate** — `poll_once()` now rejects listings with no address AND no MLS ID before saving; prevents garbage rows from bypassing both dedup checks
- **Town backfill from Redfin URLs** — data-quality fix mode extracts town/state/zip from Redfin URL paths for listings missing town data
- **Tour header stripping** — plaintext parser now strips Redfin tour headers ("N homes on this tour") before address parsing; prevents tour count from being concatenated into listing address
- **Address key backfill on startup** — `init_db()` now backfills `address_key` for any listing with address+town but NULL key; prevents Ave/Avenue-style duplicates from bypassing dedup
- **Expanded address normalization** — added parkway/pkwy, highway/hwy, trail/trl, crossing/xing, turnpike/tpke, expressway/expy suffix mappings; added directional word normalization (north→n, south→s, east→e, west→w, northeast→ne, etc.)
- **Global email age filter** — `MAX_EMAIL_AGE_DAYS` env var (default: 21); Gmail queries now include `newer_than:{days}d` to skip stale emails; prevents ingesting sold/expired listings from months-old alerts
- **`POST /manage/prune-sold` endpoint** — checks Redfin listing URLs via Jina Reader for sold/off-market status; dry-run by default, `?fix=true` deletes sold listings; protected by MANAGE_KEY
- **Bare Redfin URL parsing** — plaintext parser now handles emails with only Redfin URLs (no price/beds data); extracts address/town/state/zip from URL path; enables ingesting listings forwarded by personal contacts
- **`POST /listings/{id}/sold` endpoint** — deletes a listing and its score; auth-required; called from new "Mark as Sold" button on dashboard
- **"Mark as Sold" button** — red-themed button at top of expanded card detail; confirms before deleting; removes card from UI immediately
- **Action buttons row** — toured and sold buttons now displayed together at top of card detail section (were at bottom)

### Changed
- **Removed image management and add-URL sections** from expanded card detail; these are machine tasks, not manual ones
- **Commute: pick shortest of two strategies** — `fetch_commute_time()` now tries both direct transit (walk to station) and drive-to-station + transit, returning whichever is shorter; previously only tried drive+transit when walk-to-transit returned no routes, causing inflated times (e.g. 152 min for Briarcliff Manor when drive+transit would be ~70 min)
- **Station overrides** — added Briarcliff Manor → Scarborough, Ossining, Pleasantville to `_STATION_OVERRIDES`
- **"Pass" verdict renamed to "Weak Match"** — clearer label for AI-scored listings with score 1-39; updated in scorer, poller, dashboard CSS/filter chips, tests, and docs
- **"Pass+" filter chip renamed to "Non-Reject"** — shows all non-rejected listings regardless of score tier
- **State normalization in address keys** — `normalize_address()` now converts full state names to 2-letter codes ("New York"→"NY", "New Jersey"→"NJ", etc.); prevents duplicates when same listing arrives with "New York" from one source and "NY" from another
- **Address key recomputation on startup** — `_backfill_address_keys()` now recomputes keys for ALL listings (not just NULL), so normalization improvements apply retroactively
- **Startup dedup pass** — `_dedup_by_address_key()` runs after key recomputation; merges duplicates by keeping the listing with toured status, MLS ID, and listing URL (in priority order)
- **URL backfill via DuckDuckGo** — `/manage/scrape-descriptions` now searches DuckDuckGo for Redfin URLs for listings that have address+town but no URL; found URLs are saved before description scraping begins
- **Data-quality fix mode** — no longer deletes no-URL listings (only no-address); no-URL listings are real but just lack a clickable link
- `_rescore_all()` refactored: first pass collects IDs needing rescore (lightweight, no images loaded), then processes in chunks — build → submit → poll → process → free memory per chunk

---

## [2026-03-03]

### Added
- **Anthropic prompt caching** — system prompt now returns `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}` block; cached across all scoring calls for ~90% savings on system prompt tokens
- **Batch API for rescoring** — `_rescore_all()` now uses Anthropic Message Batches API (50% discount on all tokens); polls batch status every 30s; falls back to sequential scoring if batch submission fails
- **Skip-unchanged listings** — `_should_skip()` checks `criteria_version` + `enriched_at`/`scored_at` timestamps; listings with same criteria and no new enrichment are skipped during rescore (instant completion on re-rescore)
- **Score metadata tracking** — `enriched_at` (listings) and `scored_at` (scores) columns auto-set on update; `get_all_score_metadata()` fetches all score metadata in one query for skip logic
- `build_batch_request()` and `parse_batch_result()` helpers in `app/scorer.py`
- `rescore_state` now includes `skipped` count and `batch_id` for monitoring
- 12 new tests: batch request construction (3), batch result parsing (4), skip-unchanged logic (5)
- **Commute DRIVE fallback** — `fetch_commute_time()` now falls back to Google Routes DRIVE mode when TRANSIT returns no routes (common for suburban addresses far from train stations); `commute_mode` ("transit"|"drive") tracked in `commute_data_json`
- **Parallel commute enrichment** — `/manage/enrich` runs commute API calls in parallel (5 workers via ThreadPoolExecutor); school data calls remain serial (SchoolDigger rate limit)
- **Commute mode display** — dashboard enrichment card shows 🚆 Transit or 🚗 Driving label based on which mode was used
- 2 new tests: DRIVE fallback (1), both-modes-fail (1)

### Changed
- **Compact card layout** — cards show address on line 1, town+state on line 2; removed price/beds/sqft/badge meta row from compact view
- **Card height fix** — `.card-address` and `.card-meta` now use `-webkit-line-clamp: 2` for multi-line wrapping instead of single-line truncation; cards display ~3 visible rows
- Extracted `_build_listing_data()` and `_get_image_urls()` helpers from `_rescore_one_listing()` for reuse by both single and batch scoring paths
- Removed `ThreadPoolExecutor` from rescoring (replaced by Batch API)

- **Address-based duplicate prevention** — `normalize_address()` in `app/enrichment.py` generates normalized address keys (Avenue→Ave, Street→St, etc.); `is_listing_duplicate_by_address()` checks DB before saving; prevents "10 Sherman Avenue" (OneHome) and "10 Sherman Ave" (plaintext) from being double-ingested
- **School data enrichment** — SchoolDigger API integration (free DEV tier, 20 calls/day); fetches nearby school rankings by zip code; caches results in DB (`school_data_json`) to minimize API calls; school percentiles displayed on dashboard cards and fed into AI scoring
- **Transit commute times** — Google Routes API integration (Essentials tier, 10K free/month); calculates Metro-North + subway + walking commute to Brookfield Place NYC (next weekday 8 AM); `commute_minutes` stored in DB and displayed as badge on dashboard cards
- **AI scorer enrichment awareness** — system prompt updated to explicitly factor school quality and commute times into evaluations; mentions specific school names/percentiles and commute duration in property_summary
- **Dashboard enrichment display** — commute badge ("52min 🚆") and school score ("Schools 85%") on compact card meta line; expandable enrichment section with full school breakdown (elementary/middle/high with names, ranks, distances) and commute details; "Commute (shortest)" and "Schools (best)" sort options
- **`POST /manage/enrich` endpoint** — backfills school data + commute times for existing listings; runs in background thread to accommodate SchoolDigger's 1-call/minute rate limit; `GET /manage/enrich/status` to check progress; `?clear_bogus=true` clears obfuscated school data before re-fetching; triggers rescore after enrichment
- **`app/enrichment.py` module** — address normalization, SchoolDigger API client (v2.0), Google Routes API client
- **Town shown on listing cards** — compact card view now displays "Address, Town" instead of just the street address
- **Version history pagination** — criteria version history shows 5 per page with Newer/Older navigation instead of full unbounded list
- 36 new tests: address normalization (19), school data (5), commute time (5), state normalization (1), manage/enrich endpoint (4), DB dedup integration (2)
- 4 new DB columns: `address_key`, `school_data_json`, `commute_minutes`, `commute_data_json`
- 4 new env vars: `SCHOOLDIGGER_APP_ID`, `SCHOOLDIGGER_APP_KEY`, `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, `COMMUTE_DESTINATION`

- **Domain-level email source matching** — `ALERT_SENDERS` supports domain-level matching (e.g., `redfin.com` catches all Redfin senders: daily alerts, tour confirmations, favorited homes, market updates)
- **Date-filtered sender support** — `SENDER_DATE_FILTERS` env var (format: `email:days,email:days`) enables time-bounded email ingestion for senders like personal contacts; separate Gmail queries with `newer_than:Nd`
- **Inline address extraction** — PlainTextParser now handles Redfin-style inline addresses (`31 Lalli Dr, Katonah, NY 10536`) via `INLINE_ADDR_RE` regex; falls back after standalone street/city patterns
- **Listing URL extraction in PlainTextParser** — `LISTING_URL_RE` extracts Redfin, OneKeyMLS, and OneHome listing URLs from plain text emails; filters out non-listing URLs (tours, checkout, blog)
- **Management endpoints** — `POST /manage/cleanup` (delete listings by ID), `POST /manage/reset-emails` (clear orphaned processed emails + remove Gmail labels for re-ingestion)
- `GET /criteria/history` endpoint — returns all saved criteria versions, newest first (public, no auth); includes version number, created_by, created_at, 80-char preview, and full instructions
- Version history panel in the AI Criteria settings overlay; click any past version to load it into the editor; "Current" badge on the active version
- `get_criteria_history()` in `db.py`
- **OneKey MLS fallback scraper** — `_try_onekeymls()` in `onehome.py`; URL constructed from `address-town-state-zip/mls_id`; works from cloud IPs where Redfin is blocked; wired into fallback chain (OneHome → OneKey MLS → Redfin DDG; Redfin → static → Jina → OneKey MLS)
- **`/manage/scrape-descriptions` endpoint** — scrapes descriptions + images for listings with URLs but no description; iterates DB directly (no email re-parsing); protected by MANAGE_KEY; triggers rescore if descriptions found
- 29 new tests: email source config (6), URL extraction (4), inline address (4), verdict/score consistency (7), manage/scrape-descriptions (8)
- **Read-only AI Criteria for anonymous users** — "✨ AI Criteria" button always visible; settings panel opens in read-only mode (textarea disabled, save/maintenance hidden) for unauthenticated users; sign in to edit

### Changed
- **SchoolDigger API v2.0** — fixed endpoint URL from `/v2/schools` to `/v2.0/schools`; updated response parsing for `rankHistory[0].rankStatewidePercentage` (was top-level `rankStatewidePercentile`); city/zip read from nested `address` object
- **SchoolDigger rate limiting** — enforces 1-call-per-minute delay between API calls; detects obfuscated/bogus responses (daily limit exceeded) and rejects them instead of storing garbage data
- **Background enrichment** — `/manage/enrich` now runs in a daemon thread (returns immediately); two-phase bogus clearing (clears ALL bogus data first, then re-fetches) prevents zip cache from serving stale obfuscated data
- **Dynamic `update_listing_enrichment()`** — only updates columns present in the enrichment dict (was always setting all 4 columns, nulling out existing data on partial updates)
- **Email fetching refactored** — `fetch_new_emails()` now runs multiple query groups (regular senders + date-filtered senders) with deduplication via `_fetch_query()` helper; replaces single-query approach
- **ALERT_SENDERS default** updated from individual Redfin addresses to domain-level matching (e.g. `redfin.com`)
- **Serialized bulk re-scoring** — `_RESCORE_WORKERS` reduced from 5 to 1; image-heavy listings (18-46 images each) exceed Anthropic's 10k tokens/minute org limit when run concurrently; serial execution avoids rate limiting
- **Verdict/score consistency enforcement** in `_validate_ai_response()` — "Reject" always forces score=0; non-Reject verdicts always re-derived from score (80+=Strong Match, 60+=Worth Touring, 40+=Low Priority, >0=Weak Match); prevents filter chip mismatches
- **Selector-first description extraction** — site-specific CSS selectors (`section#overview` for OneKey MLS, `div#house-info`/`.remarksContainer` for Redfin) tried before keyword-based fallback; prevents navigation/UI boilerplate from beating real descriptions
- **Browser User-Agent for static scraping** — `_scrape_static()` now uses a real Chrome UA + Accept headers to bypass basic bot detection
- **Redfin URL handling** — static HTTP attempted first, then Jina Reader (was Jina-only)
- Image selectors expanded: `img[src*="cloudfront.net"]` (OneKey MLS CDN), `img[src*="s.cbhomes.com"]` (Coldwell Banker)
- **`_MAX_IMAGES` reduced from 10 to 5** — prevents OOM on Fly.io 256MB VMs when loading images as base64; 5 images is sufficient for basement/amenity/condition assessment

## [2026-02-28]

### Added
- **Toured listing tracking** — `toured` boolean column on `listings` table; `POST /listings/{id}/toured` endpoint (auth-required); toured badge in compact card row; "Mark as Toured / Unmark" toggle in expanded detail (auth-only); "Toured" filter chip
- **AI-generated property summary** — `property_summary` TEXT column on `scores` table; AI scorer now generates a structured factor-by-factor analysis (headline, ✅/⚠️/❓ factor lines, conclusion); displayed as primary analysis in expanded card view; falls back to legacy checklist for older listings
- **Public read-only dashboard** — `GET /listings`, `GET /listings/{mls_id}`, `GET /criteria`, `GET /rescore/status` require no auth; write/action endpoints remain auth-gated; "Sign in" button shown to unauthenticated users

### Changed
- **Removed deterministic scoring path entirely** — `score_listing()` and all hardcoded thresholds removed from `scorer.py`; `poller.py` now returns a placeholder `ScoringResult` (score=0, confidence=low) when no API key or criteria are configured
- **Removed hardcoded `DEFAULT_CRITERIA`** — no criteria are seeded on startup; criteria must be configured via the AI Criteria panel in the dashboard on first use
- `/manage/sync-criteria` repurposed: no longer pushes hardcoded criteria; now triggers a rescore with the current active criteria from DB; returns 404 if no criteria have been set
- Soft score weights updated: `ground_floor_bedroom` +25 (was +20), `lot_gte_03_acre` +10 (was +15)
- `update_score()` in `db.py` now accepts and persists `property_summary`

### Removed
- `DEFAULT_CRITERIA` string constant from `db.py`
- `_seed_default_criteria()` function from `db.py`
- `TestHardRequirements`, `TestPreScreenMode`, `TestRealListings` test classes (tested the removed deterministic scorer)

## [2026-02-15]

### Added
- **Jina Reader API scraping** — replaced Playwright with `r.jina.ai` for rendering JavaScript SPAs (OneHome Angular portal); no browser dependency required
- **Redfin scraping support** — static HTTP scraper with CSS selectors tuned for Redfin page structure; URL-type-aware routing in `scrape_listing_description()`
- **Email reprocessing** — `POST /reprocess` re-fetches all processed emails, extracts listing URLs, scrapes descriptions, and triggers rescore
- `/manage/reprocess` endpoint (API key protected) for server-side reprocessing
- Vision support — image URLs attachable via `POST /listings/{id}/images`; AI evaluator sends images as base64 to Claude Haiku

### Changed
- `scrape_listing_description()` returns `(description, image_urls)` tuple (was just description)
- Keyword-based content detection ensures scraped text contains real estate terms before accepting it

---

## [2026-01-20] — Phase 2 MVP

### Added
- **AI evaluation engine** (`app/scorer.py`) — Claude Haiku scores listings against user-defined natural language criteria; returns structured JSON (score, verdict, hard results, soft points, concerns, reasoning)
- **Prompt injection defense** — listing data wrapped in `<listing_data>` XML tags; system prompt instructs AI to treat it as untrusted data only; server-side output validation (score clamped 0–100, verdict from allowlist)
- **Editable evaluation criteria** — stored in `evaluation_criteria` table with versioning; editable via dashboard settings panel; saving triggers background rescore of all listings
- **Background re-scoring** — `_rescore_all()` runs in a daemon thread; progress exposed via `GET /rescore/status`
- Google Sign-In auth — OAuth2 ID token verification; HMAC-signed session cookies (7-day expiry); allowlisted emails only
- Fly.io deployment with Postgres backend
- `/manage/sync-criteria` endpoint (API key protected) for syncing hardcoded criteria to DB

### Changed
- Dashboard upgraded with settings overlay, rescore progress bar, filter chips (verdict-based), sort controls
- Listing cards show verdict badge, evaluation method (AI vN), confidence, AI reasoning section

---

## [2025-12-01] — Phase 1 MVP

### Added
- Gmail API integration — OAuth2 refresh token; auto-polls for new listing alert emails; labels processed emails to avoid re-processing
- **OneHome HTML parser** (`app/parsers/onehome.py`) — BeautifulSoup CSS selectors for OneKey MLS NY alert format
- **Plain text parser** (`app/parsers/plaintext.py`) — regex extraction for price, beds, baths, sqft, MLS ID
- **LLM fallback parser** (`app/parsers/llm.py`) — Claude Haiku parses ambiguous/unknown email formats
- SQLite schema (`processed_emails`, `listings`, `scores`, `evaluation_criteria` tables)
- Dual DB support — SQLite locally, Postgres in production (detected via `DATABASE_URL`)
- Idempotent schema migrations via `_migrate_add_columns()`
- Mobile-first dashboard — listing cards with score badges, price/sqft/beds display, expandable detail
- `GET /listings`, `GET /listings/{mls_id}` — listing data endpoints
- `POST /poll` — manual Gmail poll trigger
- `GET /health` — health check
