# Product Requirements Document

**Product:** Listing Analyzer
**Owner:** Aki
**Objective:** Automated Gmail alert ingestion → parse listings → AI-powered scoring against editable buyer criteria → mobile-friendly dashboard.

---

## 1. Problem

You receive listing alerts via email from your real estate agent. They contain:
- Partial address
- MLS ID
- Price + basic stats
- Tokenized OneHome links (JWT, expire quickly)

Manually reviewing each listing against your criteria is tedious and error-prone.

You want:
- Automatic email ingestion (no manual pasting)
- Structured data extraction from email alerts
- AI-powered evaluation against your specific buyer criteria
- Mobile-friendly dashboard to review and filter listings
- Editable criteria that auto-re-score all listings when changed

## 2. Goals

### Primary
- Input: Gmail listing alert emails (auto-polled)
- Output: scored + evaluated listings on a mobile dashboard

### Secondary
- Store listing history with scores
- Filter and sort listings by verdict, score, price
- Editable evaluation criteria with versioning
- Description scraping from listing pages for deeper AI evaluation
- Mark listings as toured
- Flag listings as "Want to Go" for realtor tour requests
- Add listings manually from a URL (paste Redfin link → auto-scrape + score)

### Non-goals
- Agent messaging
- Offer execution
- Comps / price analysis (future)

### Data Enrichment
- **School data** — SchoolDigger API (free DEV tier, 20 calls/day) fetches nearby school rankings by zip code; cached in DB to avoid rate limit; displayed on cards and fed into AI scoring
- **Transit commute times** — Google Routes API (Essentials tier, 10K free/month) calculates commute to Brookfield Place NYC (next weekday 8 AM); tries both walk-to-station transit and drive-to-station + transit, picks the shorter one; station overrides map towns to their nearest Metro-North station; displayed as badge on dashboard cards
- **Address-based dedup** — Normalized address keys (Avenue→Ave, Street→St, New York→NY, etc.) prevent duplicate listings across different email parsers; keys are recomputed on every startup so normalization improvements apply retroactively; startup dedup pass merges any duplicates that emerge, keeping the listing with toured status / most data

## 3. User Flow

1. Agent sends listing alert emails to your Gmail.
2. App auto-polls Gmail (configurable interval, default 1h) or user clicks "Check Email".
3. Parser extracts structured listing data from email HTML/text.
4. Listing URLs are extracted from email links; descriptions scraped from listing pages.
5. Enrichment: school rankings fetched via SchoolDigger API (cached by zip), commute times via Google Routes API.
6. AI evaluator (Claude Haiku) scores each listing against user-defined criteria, factoring in school quality and commute time.
7. User reviews scored listings on mobile dashboard (public read-only — no login required to view).
8. User can edit AI criteria → all listings auto-re-scored.
9. User can reprocess old emails to backfill URLs/descriptions after parser updates.
10. User can mark listings as toured to track which properties have been visited.
11. User can flag listings as "Want to Go" to signal tour interest to their realtor.
12. User can paste a listing URL to manually add a new listing (auto-scrapes, enriches, and scores).

## 4. System Architecture

### Input Layer
- **Gmail API** auto-polls for new listing alert emails
- Supports forwarded emails (detects and unwraps)
- Configurable sender list (env var `ALERT_SENDERS`) — supports domain-level matching (e.g., `redfin.com` catches all senders from that domain)
- Date-filtered senders (env var `SENDER_DATE_FILTERS`, format: `email:days,email:days`) — for personal contacts where only recent emails are relevant
- **Global email age filter** (env var `MAX_EMAIL_AGE_DAYS`, default: 21) — Gmail queries include `newer_than:{days}d` to skip stale/sold listings from old alert emails
- Separate Gmail queries per sender group with deduplication
- Processes each email once, marks with `ListingsAnalyzer/Processed` label

### Known Input Format: OneHome/Matrix MLS Email
Primary alert source is OneKey MLS NY email alerts.

**HTML structure** (reliable CSS selectors):
- Each listing wrapped in `<!--@Record:{ID}@-->` comment + `<DIV class="multiLineDisplay">`
- `.highlight-price` → `$1,295,000`
- `.highlight-title` → `Residential`
- `.highlight-description` → street address (`11 Jennifer Lane`)
- `.highlight-address` → city/state/zip (`Rye Brook, New York 10573`)
- `.highlight-specs` → `4 bd • 3 ba • 2,437 sqft` and `MLS #964038` (two separate `<p>` elements)
- `.highlight-status` → `<img alt="New Listing">` or `<img alt="Price Increased">`
- OneHome portal links extracted per listing (used for description scraping)

**Parsing strategy (parser chain):**
1. **OneHome HTML parser** (`app/parsers/onehome.py`) — BeautifulSoup CSS selectors (fast, deterministic)
2. **Plain text parser** (`app/parsers/plaintext.py`) — regex for `$price`, `N bd`, `N ba`, `N,NNN sqft`, `MLS #NNNNNN`; strips and captures status prefixes (New Listing, Pending, etc.); extracts inline addresses with directional suffixes (`101 Long Hill Rd E, Briarcliff Manor, NY 10510`) and listing URLs (Redfin, OneKeyMLS, OneHome); falls back to Redfin URL path for address extraction
3. **LLM fallback parser** (`app/parsers/llm.py`) — Claude Haiku for ambiguous/unknown formats

### Parsing Layer
- Extract per listing:
  - Street, Town, State, Zip
  - MLS ID
  - Price, Sqft, Bedrooms, Bathrooms
  - Property type, Listing status (New, Price Changed, etc.)
  - **Listing URL** (OneHome portal link)
- Duplicate detection by MLS ID
- **Validation gate:** listings with no address AND no MLS ID are rejected before saving (prevents garbage rows from bypassing dedup)

### Description + Image Scraping Layer
- After parsing, scrape each listing's URL for full property description and photos
- `scrape_listing_description()` in `app/parsers/onehome.py` — returns `(description, image_urls)` tuple
- **URL-aware scraping strategy with multi-site fallback:**
  - **OneHome URLs** (`portal.onehome.com`): Angular SPA — try OneKey MLS directly (if MLS ID known), then DuckDuckGo → Redfin
  - **Redfin URLs**: static HTTP (browser UA) → Jina Reader → OneKey MLS fallback
  - **Other URLs**: static HTTP → Jina Reader → DuckDuckGo Redfin search
- **OneKey MLS** (`onekeymls.com`) is the source MLS for the NY metro area; URL constructed directly from `address-town-state-zip/mls_id` — no DDG search needed, works reliably from cloud IPs
- Static HTTP uses a full browser User-Agent + Accept headers to bypass basic bot detection
- Jina Reader API (`r.jina.ai`) renders JavaScript SPAs server-side (fallback for Angular portals)
- **Selector-first extraction**: targeted CSS selectors (`section#overview` for OneKey, `div#house-info` / `.remarksContainer` for Redfin) are tried first; keyword-based fallback only used when no selector matches — prevents navigation/UI text from beating the real description
- Image extraction: targeted CDN selectors (Redfin CDN, CloudFront for OneKey, Coldwell Banker), skips icons/thumbnails
- Description + images fed to AI evaluator for deeper assessment (basement detection, amenities, condition)

### Reprocessing
- `POST /reprocess` re-fetches all previously processed emails from Gmail
- Re-parses with current parser (useful after parser updates add new extraction)
- Backfills listing URLs and descriptions for older listings
- Auto-triggers re-score if criteria exist

## 5. Evaluation Engine

### AI-Only Scoring

All scoring is performed by the **AI evaluator** (`app/scorer.py:ai_score_listing`):
- Uses Claude Haiku (vision-capable) via Anthropic API
- Follows user-defined natural language instructions (editable in dashboard, stored in DB)
- Evaluates listing data + scraped description + optional images
- Returns structured JSON: score, verdict, hard results, soft points, concerns, reasoning, **property_summary**
- Server-side validation: score clamped 0–100, verdict/score consistency enforced (see below), confidence checked

If no API key is configured, or no criteria have been set, listings are saved with a placeholder score (0, "Weak Match", low confidence) and a concern explaining why.

### AI-Generated Property Summary
Each scored listing receives a `property_summary` — a structured factor-by-factor analysis generated by the AI:
- **Line 1:** verdict — score/100 (e.g., "Worth Touring — 68/100")
- **Factor lines:** one per evaluated criterion, prefixed with ✅ (pass), ⚠️ (concern), or ❓ (unknown)
- **Blank line + conclusion:** brief 1–2 sentence assessment
- Displayed as the primary analysis section in the expanded card view

### Prompt Injection Defense
Listing data (address, description, etc.) could contain malicious instructions.
- Listing data wrapped in `<listing_data>` XML tags, never mixed into prompt prose
- System prompt explicitly instructs AI to treat listing data as DATA ONLY
- Server-side output validation (score clamped, verdict from allowed list)
- No code execution — AI returns JSON only

### Bulk Re-scoring
- Triggered when criteria are saved, or manually via `/manage/sync-criteria`
- Runs in a background daemon thread; progress exposed via `GET /rescore/status`
- **Chunked batch processing** — listings processed in chunks of 10 (`_BATCH_CHUNK_SIZE`) to keep peak memory under control; each listing can include ~6.6MB of base64-encoded images; building all requests at once caused OOM on 512MB Fly.io machines
- **Batch API** — each chunk submitted as a Message Batch (50% token discount); poll every 30s until complete; results processed and memory freed before next chunk
- Sequential fallback preserved if batch API fails on any chunk

### Evaluation Criteria (Editable)
- Stored in `evaluation_criteria` table with versioning (each save = new version row)
- Editable via dashboard settings panel ("✨ AI Criteria") — **only authenticated users** can edit
- Saving new criteria triggers background re-score of all listings
- **No hardcoded default criteria** — criteria must be entered and saved via the dashboard on first use
- Full version history available via `GET /criteria/history`; viewable in the settings panel with one-click restore

### Buyer Criteria (Current — as configured in dashboard)

**Hard Requirements** (any failure = Reject, score 0):
- >= 2,400 sqft (no upper bound — but 4,500+ sqft is a slight concern)
- 4+ bedrooms (no upper bound — but 6+ is a slight concern: unusual layout)
- Price: $1.25M–$2M (target range $1.25M–$1.5M; above $1.5M is a concern, not a reject)
- Must be detached (no townhouse, condo, co-op)
- Must have a finished basement

**Soft Features** (base score 20 + points):

| Feature | Points |
|---|---|
| Base (all hard reqs pass) | +20 |
| Ground-floor bedroom | +25 (highest priority) |
| Finished basement | +20 |
| Lot >= 0.3 acre | +10 |
| Pool | +10 |
| Sauna | +5 |
| Jacuzzi/hot tub | +5 |
| Soaking tub | +5 |

**Soft Warnings** (lower score slightly, never cause Reject):
- Price above $1.5M → -5 to -10 pts
- 4,500+ sqft → -5 to -10 pts
- 6+ bedrooms → -5 to -10 pts

### Verdict Logic

- Score >= 80 → **Strong Match**
- 60–79 → **Worth Touring**
- 40–59 → **Low Priority**
- < 40 → **Weak Match**
- Any hard fail → **Reject** (score 0)

**Server-side verdict/score consistency** (enforced in `_validate_ai_response`):
- If AI returns `"Reject"`, score is forced to 0 (hard fail always means 0 points)
- Otherwise verdict is always re-derived from score (ensures filter chips work correctly even if AI returns inconsistent values like "Weak Match" at score=42)

### Vision Support
- Image URLs can be attached to listings via `POST /listings/{id}/images`
- AI evaluator examines images for basement finish, condition, amenities
- Images fetched as base64, sent to Claude Haiku vision endpoint

## 6. Dashboard UI

Mobile-first single-page app served at `/` (`app/templates/dashboard.html`).

### Auth Model

### Add Listing from URL
- "**+ Add Listing**" bar at top of dashboard *(auth-only)* — paste any listing URL (Redfin, short redf.in links, etc.)
- Resolves short URLs, extracts address from Redfin URL path, scrapes description/images, extracts structured data (price/beds/baths/sqft), enriches with schools + commute, scores with AI
- Duplicate detection by normalized address key — rejects if listing already exists
- Loading state: button shows "Adding…", input disables during scrape; Enter key submits
- Source format stored as `"manual"` to distinguish from email-ingested listings

### URL/Description Management
- Listings without URLs show input field + "Scrape & Score" button *(auth-only)*
- Scraping fetches description from listing page and auto-re-scores

## 9. Key Technical Decisions

### Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.12+
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **DB:** SQLite (local) / Postgres (production, detected via `DATABASE_URL`)
- **Deployment:** Fly.io (Docker)
- **Dependencies:** managed with `uv`
- **Scraping:** httpx (static) + Jina Reader API (SPA rendering, no browser needed)

### AI Evaluation
- Claude Haiku (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) — cheap, fast, supports vision
- AI-only scoring (no deterministic fallback)
- Structured JSON output with server-side validation
- AI generates both a score + a `property_summary` narrative per listing

### Email Integration
- Gmail API with OAuth2 (refresh token)
- Background polling thread (configurable interval)
- Labels processed emails to avoid re-processing

### Auth
- Google Sign-In (OAuth2 ID token verification)
- Session cookies (HMAC-signed, 7-day expiry)
- Allowlisted emails only
- **Dashboard is public (read-only)** — auth only required for write actions

## 10. Edge Cases

- Duplicate MLS IDs → deduplicated on insert
- Missing description → AI evaluates with available data, marks unknown criteria
- Forwarded emails → detected and unwrapped before parsing
- Parser updates → reprocess endpoint backfills data from existing emails
- No API key configured → placeholder score saved (score=0, confidence=low, reason in concerns)
- No criteria set → placeholder score saved (score=0, confidence=low, reason in concerns)
- Prompt injection in listing data → XML-tagged isolation + system prompt defense
- Multi-story / non-standard layouts (e.g., 34 Lakeshore Drive — upper/lower floors, no clear basement) → AI may Reject on "finished basement" hard requirement; these should be reviewed manually for future AI criteria refinement
- **Status prefix stripping** — Redfin alert emails prepend status labels ("New Listing", "Pending", "Coming Soon", "Price Drop", etc.) as plain text before listing data. The plaintext parser strips these and captures them in `listing_status`. Known labels: New Listing, Pending, Coming Soon, New Favorite, Price Drop, Price Decreased, Price Increased, Back on Market, Sold, Contingent, Under Contract, Active, Open House, New Tour Insight, Updated MLS Listing.
- **Tour header stripping** — Redfin tour emails prepend "N homes on this tour" before listing blocks. The plaintext parser strips these via `TOUR_HEADER_RE` to prevent the tour count from being concatenated into the listing address.
- **Directional address suffixes** — Street addresses may end with a cardinal direction (N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW) after the street type suffix (e.g., "101 Long Hill Rd E"). Both `STREET_RE` and `INLINE_ADDR_RE` patterns handle optional directional suffixes.
- **Address-less listings** — Listings without an extractable address fall back to Redfin URL parsing, then zip-code-only. Address-less listings can be cleaned up via `/manage/data-quality?fix=true` (or manually via `/manage/cleanup`) and re-ingested via reset + poll.
- **DB connection timeouts** — `psycopg2` connections use `connect_timeout=5` (5s TCP connect) and `statement_timeout=30000` (30s query); SQLite uses `timeout=5` (5s lock wait). Prevents indefinite hangs when Postgres is temporarily unreachable.
- **Listings without clickable links** — Some listings ingested from Redfin daily alert emails have address/price data but no listing URL. This happens when the plaintext email body contains inline addresses without accompanying Redfin links (URLs were only in the HTML portion, which the plaintext parser doesn't process). `/manage/scrape-descriptions` attempts to find Redfin URLs via DuckDuckGo search; remaining no-URL listings are typically off-market, have unusual address formats DDG can't match, or are in areas Redfin doesn't cover. As of 2026-03-04, 35 listings have no URL:
  - **Parsing artifacts (1):** id=498 "44 S. Broadway, Suite 100| White Plains" — pipe-delimited town field indicates a parsing bug; MLS #3030
  - **New Jersey listings (3):** ids 506-508 — Basking Ridge, Bernardsville area; likely from a forwarded NJ search; DDG couldn't find Redfin pages
  - **Westchester NY (28):** ids 510-544, 720-723 — Chappaqua, Briarcliff Manor, Ossining, Pleasantville, Sleepy Hollow, Scarsdale, Ardsley; many are likely off-market or have addresses DDG couldn't match to Redfin listings
  - **Connecticut (1):** id=725 "332 Riversville Rd, Greenwich" — DDG didn't find a Redfin page
  - **Future mitigation:** Parsing the HTML portion of Redfin emails would capture URLs directly; alternatively, constructing Redfin URLs from address slugs (address-town-state-zip format) could bypass DDG search
